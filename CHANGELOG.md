### 24.0.0

* \[**BREAKING**\] Add taller slash, broken slash and broken zero variants for Zero. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1307, #1509, #1678).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Add above-baseline crossed variant for Q. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1533).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Add `threefold-solid-inline` variant for `@`. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1495).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Rectify the variant atlas. As a result, if a character's variant list has motion-serifed, then it will have serifless and serifed variants: the serifed-ness will no longer be controlled by SLAB variable. The characters influenced are `M`, `N`, `P`, `R`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `b`, `h`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `y`.
* \[**BREAKING**\] Renamed and/or reordered various variants.

  - TRIPLE HORIZONTAL BAR WITH DOUBLE VERTICAL STROKE (`U+2A68`).
  - TRIPLE HORIZONTAL BAR WITH TRIPLE VERTICAL STROKE (`U+2A69`).
  - ALMOST EQUAL TO WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT (`U+2A6F`).
